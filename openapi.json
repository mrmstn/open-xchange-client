Because the available tests depend on the mail filter server, these tests must be determined at runtime. So that no test field is transferred to the server which it isn't able to handle. Examples for tests are `address`, `allof` and `anyof`.\nEach test has a special comparison.

Each field provides an array of objects.\n\nThe \"platforms\" field lists the available platforms for which a device can receive on-boarding information.\n\nThe \"devices\" field lists the concrete devices, which are supported to receive on-boarding information. Each object mainly provides:\n- A unique identifier for the associated device (e.g. \"apple.iphone\") and a display name\n- Whether the device is enabled; \"false\" to trigger upsell activities\n- A listing of applicable scenarios for the device consisting of composite identifiers (delimited by \"/\" character), which point to an entry from the \"matching\" object\n\nThe \"scenarios\" field provides all available on-boarding scenarios (like installing an app or receive a profile configuration for a built-in application; e.g. Apple Mail). Each scenario also provides:\n- A unique identifier and a display name\n- Whether the scenario is enabled along-side with \"missing_capabilities\" to trigger upsell activities\n- A description text for the user\n\nThe \"actions\" field represents the available actions that can be performed in order to transfer a certain on-boarding information to a device. As of now there are five possible actions for a certain device/scenario combination: \"download\", \"email\", \"display\", \"link\" and \"sms\".\n- \"download\" refers to a simple download that is performed; e.g. a profile configuration file.\n- \"email\" lets the Middleware to send out an E-Mail containing the on-boarding information.\n- \"sms\" lets the Middleware to send out an SMS containing the on-boarding information.\n- \"display\" represents a plain display of on-boarding information for manual setup. Actions of this type provide a composite identifier (delimited by \"/\" character) that also contains the concrete scenario to which that action applies; e.g. \"display/davsync\". Moreover it has a \"data\" field that provides the user-sensitive information to display; e.g. the mail settings.\n- \"link\" hints to an available link that a user can follow; e.g, a link to a certain app held in an app store. Actions of this type provide a composite identifier (delimited by \"/\" character) that also contains the concrete scenario to which that action applies. In addition there is a field for each device providing the exact link and type; e.g. having a link to Apple Appstore for an iPhone device.\n\nThe \"matching\" field is the combination of supported device, scenario and actions combinations. It provides an \"id\" field that contains a composite identifier (delimited by \"/\" character) to refer to the device and scenario combination; e.g. \"apple.ipad/mailsync\". Moreover, there is a listing of available action identifiers (pointing to entries from \"actions\") that are possible being executed in order to let such a device being on-boarded for the referenced scenario.'\n","schema":{"$ref":"#/definitions/ClientOnboardingResponse"}}}}},"/onboarding?action=execute":{"put":{"operationId":"executeClientOnboarding","tags":["Clientonboarding"],"summary":"Performs a certain client on-boarding action for a given device and scenario; e.g. download a profile or send an E-Mail/SMS","consumes":["application/json"],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/parameters/gblQueryParamSession"},{"in":"query","name":"id","type":"string","description":"The compiste identifier of device and scenario pair; e.g. \"apple.iphone/davsync\"","required":true},{"in":"query","name":"action_id","type":"string","description":"The identifier of action to perform; one of\n- download\n- email\n- sms\n- display or\n- link\n","required":true},{"in":"body","name":"body","description":"An optional JSON object containing additional data for the action.","schema":{"type":"string"}}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"'The appropriate result object or binary data dependent on specified action.

The facet's type and its value are strictly\ncoupled, in a way that a display name for both, facet and value would be redundant. A simple facet generally\ndenotes a logical field like 'phone number'. Internally this logical field can map to several internal\nfields (e.g. 'phone_private', 'phone_mobile', 'phone_business'). In clients the facet as a whole can be\ndisplayed as a single item. Example: \"Search for 'term' in field 'phone number'\".\n#### Default facets\nA default facet contains multiple values and may be present multiple times in search requests to filter\nresults by a combination of different values (e.g. \"mails with 'foo' and 'bar' in subject\").\n\nFacet values may be one- or two-dimensional. A one-dimensional value can be displayed as is and contains an\naccording filter object. A two-dimensional value contains an array \"options\" with every option defining\ndifferent semantics of how the value is used to filter the search results.\n#### Exclusive facets\nAn exclusive facet is a facet where the contained values are mutually exclusive. That means that the facet\nmust only be present once in an autocomplete or query request.\n\nFacet values may be one- or two-dimensional.
